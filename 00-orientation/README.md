# 🧭 Orientation

> **Purpose**: Build the correct mental posture for HackerOne bug bounty hunting — how professionals orient themselves before touching tools, payloads, or automation.

---

## 1. What Orientation *Really* Means in Real Bug Bounties

Orientation is **not**:
- Creating a HackerOne account
- Reading the program rules once
- Watching roadmap or “top 10 bugs” videos

Orientation is about **calibrating your thinking** to how real companies, real engineers, and real triage teams operate.

In real HackerOne programs, orientation means:
- Understanding what organizations **actually value**
- Understanding how **triage filters reports**
- Understanding why most reports fail **before** any technical validation
- Accepting that technical correctness ≠ accepted vulnerability

Orientation is the foundation that determines whether:
- You waste months submitting low‑signal reports  
or  
- You build consistent credibility and long‑term payouts

If orientation is wrong, every future skill is misapplied.

## 2. Why Orientation Matters on HackerOne

HackerOne is **not a hacking playground**.  
It is a **risk‑management marketplace**.

### 🧪 Triage Reality

Triage teams:
- Process large volumes of low‑quality reports
- Optimize for speed and risk reduction
- Reward **clarity, impact, and reproducibility**

They do **not** reward:
- Effort
- Clever payloads
- Long tool outputs

Proper orientation teaches you:
- How triage thinks under pressure
- How to frame findings for acceptance
- How to avoid “Informative / N/A” outcomes

---

### 🎯 Scope Is a Legal Boundary

Scope is not a suggestion or challenge — it is **explicit permission**.

Common beginner misunderstanding:
> “If it’s technically vulnerable, it should count.”

Reality:
- Scope defines what you are legally allowed to test
- Out‑of‑scope bugs are rejected **even if critical**
- Many assets look in‑scope but are implicitly excluded

Orientation trains you to:
- Read scope like a contract
- Identify implicit exclusions
- Understand why “related assets” often don’t count

---

### 💰 Payout Alignment

Bounties are paid for **risk reduction**, not hacking skill.

Orientation helps you:
- Focus on issues that reduce real business risk
- Avoid bugs that are “cool but irrelevant”
- Understand why some severe bugs pay low and others pay high

## 3. How Experienced Hunters Orient Themselves

Experienced hunters do not start with tools.

They start with **questions**:

- What does this company care about protecting?
- What would hurt them if abused quietly?
- What assumptions does this system rely on?
- Where do users, services, or roles change?

Their orientation process usually includes:

1. **Business Context Mapping**
   - Revenue models
   - User roles
   - Trust relationships

2. **Asset Criticality Ranking**
   - Authentication systems
   - Financial flows
   - Internal APIs
   - Admin interfaces

3. **Failure Tolerance Analysis**
   - What breaks loudly vs silently?
   - What failures trigger alerts?
   - What failures go unnoticed?

Orientation narrows the search space before any testing begins.

## 4. Common Beginner Mistakes

### ❌ Treating Orientation as a One‑Time Step
Orientation is continuous.
- Scope changes
- Features evolve
- Security posture shifts

Professionals re‑orient before every serious hunt.

---

### ❌ Chasing Vulnerabilities Instead of Risk
Beginners look for:
- XSS
- SQLi
- IDOR

Professionals look for:
- Broken assumptions
- Trust violations
- Abuse paths

The vulnerability label comes **after** the reasoning.

---

### ❌ Ignoring Triage Psychology
Many reports fail because:
- Impact is unclear
- Abuse scenario is unrealistic
- The report assumes too much knowledge

Orientation teaches you to **educate**, not confront.

---

### ❌ Confusing CTF Logic with Production Reality
CTFs reward:
- Creativity
- Edge cases
- Puzzles

Bug bounties reward:
- Stability of impact
- Reproducibility
- Realistic attacker behavior

---

## 5. Practical Orientation Mental Model

### 🧠 Core Mental Model

Think of each program as:
> A set of promises the company believes its system keeps.

Your job is to:
> Show how one promise fails in a way that matters.

---

### 🔍 Orientation Checklist

Before serious testing:
- [ ] What assets are truly critical?
- [ ] Who are the trusted actors?
- [ ] What assumptions are never validated?
- [ ] Where does data or authority change?
- [ ] What failures would go unnoticed?

If you can’t answer these, don’t test yet.

## 6. How Orientation Fits Into My Long‑Term Growth

Mastering orientation:
- Increases report acceptance rate
- Reduces burnout and random hunting
- Builds a reputation for high‑signal findings

This skill compounds across:
- Web
- APIs
- Mobile
- Cloud
- AI systems

Orientation is not optional — it is professional discipline.

### Final Mentor Note

If you orient correctly, tools become multipliers.  
If you orient poorly, tools become noise generators.

Orientation is the silent advantage most hunters never develop.
